## Description
This project allowed me to utilize some of the new skills I learned in this week's class. This project taught me how use the "node init -y" command to install package JSON, use inquirer and fs. When using inquirer, I got to play around with some of the different types that are available to use. I then took the data aquired from the prompt messages and wrote it to a file using fs. I used a template literal to create the template of the markdown directly in the index.js file. If it was a larger template, I would have put it in a separate file and used fs to read in the template. I figured out how to use SHIELDS.IO to display badges. I learned how to properly size headings in markdown and create a table of contents.
